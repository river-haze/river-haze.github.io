		<h1>language</h1>
		<p>Your words and your grammar do not exist exclusively within your words and your grammar. They exist wherever your mind can be found. And they will be found... consciously or otherwise... by you or by others.</p>
		<p>Consider a hand shake. Consider a wave. Consider a hug. Consider a silence. Consider a dog. Consider a star.</p>
		<p>Consider the meaning of all these things. Imagine them also in different contexts. Silence at night can be indicative all being right. Silence after telling a joke can be indicative all being very far from right.</p>
		<p>Your language is not just words and the grammar you use to construct sentences from those words. It is anything and everything you associate meaning with. It is you. Your language is unique as a result. The meaning you have for something varies from the meaning anyone else has for the same thing. You have your own personal language.</p>
		<p>I hope you can learn your own language. And then I hope you can learn the language of others. Yours is beautiful and so is that of theirs.</p>
